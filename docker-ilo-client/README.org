* docker-ilo-client
A fork of https://github.com/sshnaidm/docker-ilo-client/ with the intent of
being able to access ancient iLO through a SOCKS tunnel (e.g. SSH
DynamicForward).

...that part doesn't really work though...

** Usage
Start the container:
#+begin_src sh
docker run -ti --rm                     \
       --network host                   \
       -e HILO_HOST=https://10.10.23.20 \
       -p 5900:5900                     \
       runejuhl/docker-ilo-client
#+end_src

Connect to it using a VNC client:
#+begin_src sh
vncviewer localhost:5900
#+end_src

** Known bugs
*** Automatic SOCKS proxy settings
...yeah, doesn't quite work.
